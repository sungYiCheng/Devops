    Hint
    Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.



    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.


    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
    0 <= k <= nums.length
     * 
     */


    public partial class Solution
    {
        public int LongestOnes(int[] nums, int k)
        {
            return 1;
        }
    }
}
